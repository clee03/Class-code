# Homework
  * Google [How to Read a Paper](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+read+a+paper) and read that paper. ETA: 10mins
  * Google [The Status of the P Versus NP Problem By Lance Fortnow](https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Status+of+the+P+Versus+NP+Problem+By+Lance+Fortnow) and do a "first pass" as described in "How to Read a Paper". ETA: 14mins

I don't expect you to know what this paper is about; don't get bogged down in details. Just see what you can get in the 14 minute skim.

For example:
> The discovery of the now-celebrated Code of Hammurabi (hereinafter simply termed "the Code") has made possible a more systematic study than could have resulted from just the classification and interpretation of other material. Fragments of other Ancient codes exist and have been published, but there still remain many points whereof evidence is still lacking. There survive legal texts from the earliest writings through the Hellenistic period, but evidence on a particular point may be very full for one period and almost entirely lacking for another.

I don't know anything about this subject, but we can tell a few things.
  * "The Code" is a pretty big deal
  * it's unusually complete or thorough
  * it relates to many other ancient texts

Just try to get a handle on the big picture: what's important, how the important things relate, and why we care.
