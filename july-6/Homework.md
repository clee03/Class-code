# Homework
This one is easy. Go to the wikipedia page for [Computer Science topics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_computer_science) and click through a link or two until you get to a page you are vaguely curious about (or until you are bored of clicking). Use skimming techniques to try to get the basic gist of this subject, whatever you landed on.

Write *one* sentence about what this subject is about and email it to me. Exactly one. No more than one, no run-on sentences. I estimate your time commitment for this homework to be roughly 25 minutes. Don't overthink it.
